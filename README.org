#+TITLE: Shapeless HTML

~ox-shapelesshtml~ is an HTML export backend for org mode in Emacs.

* Feature
It is based on [[https://github.com/balddotcat/ox-slimhtml][ox-slimhtml]], which solves a lot of issues in the
default org HTML export backend, the generated HTML file is a lot more
minimal. "ox-shapelesshtml" provides some extra features for my
personal needs, especially in blogging.

- No extra newline character in paragraph for Asian languages,
  which turns into a space when rendered in browser.
- Support for quote block.

* Installation
Put ~ox-shapelesshtml.el~ into your load path.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-shapelesshtml)
#+end_src

* Dependencies
